cabrillo_id -- ARRL-SS-CW, ARRL-VHF-JUN, etc
year -- year in yyyy format
callsign -- callsign used on the air
host_callsign -- used to be known as @<callsign>
operators -- list of operators, blank separated, no punctuation
    Note:  For example, a score coming from NN1N would have callsign, host_callsign and operators each set to NN1N
    Note:  A multi-op score coming from WX3B that lists no operators would have callsign and host_callsign set to WX3B and operators set to NULL
category_id -- HQ-CAT: from log
section_id -- NULL -or- ARRL section abbreviation 
dxcc_prefix -- NULL -or- DXCC prefix from AD1C's list
    Note: every line score has either has a section_id OR a dxcc_prefix but not both, for example Puerto Rico is PR in Sweepstakes but KP4 in ARRL DX
score
q_total -- total QSOs
m_total -- total multipliers
late_log_flag -- 0 if log received before deadline OR callsign listed in Extensions.lis; 1 otherwise
clb_abbr -- HQ-CLUB-ABBR: from log
minutes_on -- minutes of on-time (if available)
